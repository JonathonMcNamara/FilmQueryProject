# FilmQueryProject

# Description
This program is run through the terminal querying a sql database
In this specific application, we are querying the film table
The user is able to search for a film through either an ID or some keywords
When the user finds a movie(s) from their search, they are then given information regarding the movie as well as actors involved with the movie
# Technologies Used
This program is mostly run through Java while also using MySQL as the database
In this program, there are quite a lot of methods that interpret data from the database
Upon receiving the data, the program converts it to local data and displays it for the user
SQL strings, Connectivity Strings, Prepared Statments, and ResultSets play the core of this program to get information from the database
# Lessons Learned
Upon being assigned this program, it was very easy to have a funadmental layout with a database for how to go about the program, and almost made it easier to plan for. 
I think that once we start building our own databases in the future, the planning involved will need to be much more attentive then there were here 
This program really made it so that I had to pay attention to detail with every statement otherwise you can run into a lot of errors
